# NOTICE
## Installation
### NEVER INSTALL other installation package during installation.

The professor (for part time) in my DBMS course recommends students as follows.
  
      NEVER INSTALL other installation package during installation.
      Otherwise, it must install other installation package via MongoDB server with internect.
      Thus, it will take for a long time.
