## Appreciation
### Author chainhao
Feel very thankful to chainhao, a professor which is invited by a professor in my current DBMS course.

Although one only tought us for 2 hours, one provided more useful installation packages and example datas, saving us lots of time.

Additionally, one also has established a website which provides lots of knowledge base about MongoDB.

Thank you chainhao.
